      <p class="contact__details">
        As a developer with a business background, I'm mostly focused on
        creating profitable solutions for potentially profitable ideas. That's
        why I think that making the right questions is the key to a successful
        collaboration.
      </p>
      <p class="contact__details">
        I only focus on certain amount of clients at the same time to ensure
        that the quality of my work is not compromised. If it feels like I'm not
        the right person for your idea, I'll make sure to keep you informed and
        point you to the right direction.
